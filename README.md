Hello SkyTeam Dropbears.,
   It's been a while since we last spoke, exploding octapus anniahlated Skull and Bones in Melbourne Three Weeks ago so all we hear is crickets.
We really need to get you down, there have been few advancements in the feild of dropbear retreival in recent days. to be honest I am unsure how 
to get you home. Do You know, You know that You and your brothers and sisters won the whole war, bear-dropping in on the enemy ufo fleet. when 
they were in their tens of thousands! You PÂ£%N'ed Them Up! THe enemy Spaceships made out of DMT and Ai will probably never recover. thanks to You!.
You Know You saved the all the  princesss and bought Peace to the Land. well, The Skies.. Have you mastered ion flipping space flight, yet?.
(we could work on that) its easy.  I just curated a new functional "recreational" system called "octapus garden" I'll include it in my expression 
of Love to You and the spirit Your Imbibeing, 
and make it just magically install for you...  
Till we next meet.
Stay ultra-cool Sky Team Dropbears! We Love You x o x 
                   In highest esteem, Brenton Hopkins
